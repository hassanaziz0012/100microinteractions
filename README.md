# 100 Micro-Interactions

A personal challenge to create 100 micro-interactions using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What's this all about?

I'm challenging myself to build 100 different micro-interactions to level up my front-end skills.

Micro-interactions are those tiny animations and responses that happen when you interact with a UI element. They're the small moments that make using apps and websites feel alive and responsive. Think of:

-   Heart button animations on social media
-   Pull-to-refresh feedback
-   Toggle switches with satisfying transitions
-   Button hover/click effects
-   Form field validation animations
-   Loading spinners with personality

Each one might seem minor, but they add up to create an experience that feels polished and thoughtful. In fact, these are extremely seamless animations. You usually never notice them when they happen, but you definitely feel something off when they're not there.

## Why am I doing this?

This is my next goal when it comes to improving my web design skills and crafting *delightful* user experiences. 

Building 100 different micro-interactions will teach me to:

-   Get creative with animation techniques
-   Better understand timing and easing
-   Think more deeply about user feedback
-   Expand my CSS and JavaScript animation skills
